      <title>Overview</title>
      <para id="id1171151432502">Today, you will begin to learn about the atmosphereâ€”the air that surrounds Earth. Even though the atmosphere is mostly invisible gases, it plays important roles in protecting the Earth, regulating its temperature, and helping to sustain life. At the end of the lesson, your teacher will show you some cool tools that will let you measure the weather and air pollution outside your school and learn more about the air around you!</para>
